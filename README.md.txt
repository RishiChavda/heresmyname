"The place where stories live and people are written"

This project was a venture I embarked on during my college years to create a central communal space for new stories to be written and shared. I eventually dropped the project as I got quite busy with my university studies and could no longer develop and maintain the site along with marketing it in an effective way. But that being said, it was quite successful (5-10 active users a month).
